# Tor Weather

Tor Weather will inform the user listed in [torrc's](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay.html.en) `ContactInfo` field in the event of downtime lasting longer than 48 hours.

## Tor Weather's History

The original Tor Weather was decommissioned by the Tor project and this replacement is now maintained independently and its source code can be found in this GitHub repo. More info about about the original Tor Weather can be found [here](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2016-June/009424.html).

Unlink the original Tor Weather this project only sends emails for down time to the nodes owner. It does not send emails about t-shirts or allow anyone to subscribe. Reducing the scope of Tor Weather makes it easier to maintain.
