Dear relay operators,

I learned today that Tor Weather is already offline since May 24 due
to problems with our hosting company.

We briefly thought about recreating it from backups, but it seems that
we'd rather spend that effort on other things.

Again, sorry for any inconvenience.

All the best,
Karsten
